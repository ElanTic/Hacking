## Objetivo
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦
